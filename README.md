# Fuss-Free-Fashion

Welcome to my capstone project for the General Assembly Data Science Immersive Course.

The project focuses on developing a recommender system to suggest the right clothing fit for online consumers, with the goal of growing customer satisfaction and reducing business costs (in the form of product returns and exchanges). 

The project will feature a recommender system using customers' ratings to recommend clothing and accessories, and a classification model predicting fit based on user and item attributes to fulfill the objective. The recommender models used are item-based collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.

The capstone presentation slides provide a more detailed overview of the business case and the results from the recommender system. The classification model is currently a work in progress and will be updated soon.
