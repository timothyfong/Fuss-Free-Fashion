that said, i wore the dress to dinner anyway. in walking through the venetian to get to the restaurant, i was stopped by no fewer than 4 total strangers, who all gave me gushing compliments on the dress! all the compliments actually made us late to dinner! my husband said it was like walking through a casino with a celebrity :)

unfortunately, the dress was also really uncomfortable to sit in - the sequins dug into the backs of my legs, in addition to the scratch-factor.  in the end, i only wore it to dinner, and changed into something lighter and more comfortable for the rest of the evening.

fabric: very stretchy and not as structured as i thought it might be. however with the pattern, the stretchiness does not lead to unsightly bulges, like it might in a solid. the pattern helps camoflauge!

a few nitpicks and notes: the dress is a bit long.  even with 4 inch heels i was holding up the 0r just a bit when i walked.  the size 0 dress was not in the best shape - there are three hooks on the upper portion of the back, and the top hook was extremely loose.  the hook on the bottom portion of the back (below the hole) was also missing.  i used a few pieces of fashion tape to keep everything close to my body.

note you have to wear a bra extender with this.  the dress is a little heavy, so be careful your bra doesn't show as the back tended to sag (and therefore reveal the fashion tape revealed above.)

cons of the dress. 
the sleeves were long on me. they hit about half way down my hands. 
even though it is a high-neck, i had to wear a strapless bra as straps showed.
it is kind of formal and conservative because of the stitching. the black dress is pretty sexy though.

pros of the dress.
the fabric is high quality and feels good on. even though it is thick, it breaths. 
the dress is flattering.
the dress looked good with both booties and heels. i tried both but settled on black booties.

the 3 (rather than 4) stars has more to do with the fact that there were many plastic threads sticking out where sequins had been pulled. however, you could not see that sequins were missing when the dress was on, and the complexity of the pattern helped to hide the threads.
